- Initial meeting, setup this github repo




Go through and find all the assembler directives (periods) 

go through the whole program to resolve align

+ make an array with memory locations like this [0,6,0xc,0x11,0x14]


code
code[3] = 00000000 - 8 bytes
code[11] = 00000000

Go through and find all the symbollic names (colons) + make hashmap


Read through all the Ifun+Icodes

is it possible to do 10-byte alignment?
